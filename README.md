 # Single Row Playing Cards Holder

<!--- 
SUMMARY
A brief summary of the project. What it does, who it is for, how much it costs.
 --->
The Single Row Playing Cards Holder is an assistive device for holding playing cards. This fully 3D-printed device aims to assist those with limited hand dexterity by giving them an alternate means of holding their playing cards. Users can place their cards into the tabletop holder which will discreetly display their cards during gameplay. 

This design was created by [Shane Kartz](https://www.thingiverse.com/skartz/designs) and posted on [Printables.com](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2745725).
